abc is a joint project between the Programming Tools Group at Oxford
University, UK and the Sable Research Group at McGill University,
Quebec.

abc is built on a number of existing efforts:
 - AspectJ language design <http://www.aspectj.org>
 - ajc runtime library and testing harness <http://www.aspectj.org>
 - Polyglot, an extensible compiler framework for Java 
   <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot/>
 - Soot, a Java optimisation framework <http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/>
 - Jedd, a Java extension for Decision Diagrams 
   <http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/jedd/>
 - Paddle, a BDD-based analysis toolkit for Java
   <http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/paddle>
 - JavaBDD, a BDD package for Java
   <http://javabdd.sourceforge.net/>
