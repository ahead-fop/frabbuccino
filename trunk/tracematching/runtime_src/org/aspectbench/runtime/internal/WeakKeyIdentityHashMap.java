 * Part of the Indexing Data Structure implementation. This is a HashMap-like
 * data structure that uses key identity as the basis for comparison. It isn't
 * quite conformant to the java.util.Map interface, since its hasNext() method
 * is (by design) unreliable. Instead, next() should be called and the return
 * value checked for non-nullness.
 *
 * This class uses weak references for its keys, but does *not* drop a mapping
 * after a key expires -- it is still iterable.
 * 
 * Only the methods of the Map interface that are required by the IDS are
 * implemented, all others just throw an exception.
